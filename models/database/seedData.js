        For me, there is no better of the two. Ragnarok Mobile is pretty much way better for people that are always busy and just want some casual gameplay without being left out by hardcore players that much. Ragnarok PC however is for hardcore grinders since Ragnarok is a very grindy game in the PC Version.

        Hello NexusHub Members,
        <br><br>
        As the administrator of NexusHub, I'd like to take a moment to remind everyone of our forum rules.
        These rules are put in place to ensure a respectful, constructive, and enjoyable environment for all
        members. Please take a moment to review them:
        <br><br>
        <strong>1. Respect Others</strong>: Treat all members with respect and courtesy. Personal attacks, insults,
        harassment, or any form of discrimination will not be tolerated.
        <br><br>
        <strong>2. No Hate Speech or Offensive Content</strong>: Do not post any content that promotes hate speech, racism,
        sexism, homophobia, or any form of discrimination. This includes offensive language, images, or links.
        <br><br>
        <strong>3. Keep it Civil</strong>: Debate and discussion are encouraged, but it must remain civil.
        Avoid flame wars, trolling, or baiting other members.
        <br><br>
        <strong>4. Stay on Topic</strong>: Keep discussions relevant to the forum categories and threads.
        Off-topic posts may be removed or moved to the appropriate section.
        <br><br>
        <strong>5. No Spam or Self-Promotion</strong>: Do not spam the forum with irrelevant or repetitive content.
        Avoid excessive self-promotion, advertising, or affiliate links. Promotion of other forums or
        websites requires prior approval from the moderators. Please only promote on the appropriate
        channels for promoting!
        <br><br>
        <strong>6. Respect Privacy</strong>: Do not share personal information about yourself or others without consent.
        Respect the privacy of fellow members.
        <br><br>
        <strong>7. Copyright and Intellectual Property</strong>: Do not post copyrighted material unless you have
        permission to do so. Always give credit to the original source when sharing content.
        <br><br>
        <strong>8. No Illegal Activities</strong>: Do not engage in or promote any illegal activities, including
        but not limited to piracy, hacking, or sharing of illegal software or content.
        <br><br>
        <strong>9. Moderator Instructions</strong>: Follow the instructions of moderators and administrators. If you
        have concerns or questions, contact them privately rather than publicly disputing their decisions.
        <br><br>
        <strong>10. Report Violations</strong>: If you see any violations of these rules, report them to the moderators
        using the appropriate channels. Do not engage in vigilante actions.
        <br><br>
        <strong>11. Multiple Accounts</strong>: Only one account per user is allowed. Creating multiple accounts may
        result in a ban.
        <br><br>
        <strong>12. Language and Tone</strong>: Use clear and respectful language. Avoid excessive swearing, offensive
        language, or aggressive tones.
        <br><br>
        <strong>13. Quality Contributions</strong>: Strive to contribute meaningful and constructive content to the forum.
        Avoid low-effort or one-word responses.
        <br><br>
        <strong>14. Stay Informed</strong>: Familiarize yourself with the forum's guidelines and rules. Ignorance of
        the rules is not an excuse for violating them.
        <br><br>

        Welcome, aspiring adventurers, to the world of Ragnarok Online! Embarking on your journey
        into Midgard can be both exciting and daunting, especially when it comes to choosing and
        advancing your first job. Fear not, for this beginner's guide is here to help you navigate
        the process and set you on the path to greatness.
        <br><br>
        1. Understanding the Basics:
        <br>
        Before delving into job advancements, it's essential to grasp the fundamentals of Ragnarok Online.
        Familiarize yourself with the game's mechanics, controls, and user interface. Take some time to
        explore Prontera, the starting city, and interact with NPCs to learn more about the world around you.
        <br><br>
        2. Choosing Your First Job:
        <br>
        In Ragnarok Online, players begin their journey as Novices, the jack-of-all-trades class.
        As you gain experience and reach Base Level 10, you'll have the opportunity to choose your
        first job. Consider your preferred playstyle, whether it's dealing damage up close, casting
        spells from a distance, or providing support to your party members. Research the available
        job classes and their respective skills to find the one that suits you best.
        <br><br>
        3. Job Advancement Quests:
        <br>
        Once you've made your decision, it's time to undergo the job advancement process. Each
        job class has its own unique quest that must be completed to advance. These quests often
        involve gathering items, defeating monsters, or performing tasks for NPCs. Pay close
        attention to the quest requirements and follow the instructions carefully to successfully
        advance to your chosen job.
        <br><br>
        4. Building Your Character:
        <br>
        As you progress through your chosen job class, you'll have the opportunity to
        customize your character's skills and attributes. Experiment with different builds
        to find the playstyle that best suits you. Whether you prefer to specialize in offensive,
        defensive, or supportive abilities, there's a build out there to match your preferences.
        Don't be afraid to seek advice from experienced players or consult online guides for build
        recommendations.
        <br><br>
        5. Leveling Up and Exploring:
        <br>
        With your new job class in hand, it's time to venture forth into the world of Ragnarok Online
        and embark on your quest for adventure. Explore new maps, defeat monsters, complete quests,
        and participate in party activities to level up and improve your skills. Take advantage of the
        game's social features to join parties, make friends, and tackle challenges together.
        <br><br>
        6. Embracing the Journey:
        <br>
        Remember, Ragnarok Online is not just about reaching the highest level or obtaining the most
        powerful gear. It's about the experiences you have along the way, the friends you make, and
        the adventures you embark on together. Embrace the journey, savor the moments, and enjoy
        everything that Midgard has to offer.
        <br><br>
        Congratulations on taking your first steps into the world of Ragnarok Online! May your journey be filled with excitement, discovery, and countless epic battles. If you ever find yourself in need of guidance or assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to your fellow adventurers. Welcome to Midgard, and may your adventures be legendary!

        Welcome to the newest upgrade of the forum!
        <br><br>
        The forum has been upgraded. Let's thank our admins for the hard work that they have put in to
        improve the quality of NexusHub!!
        <br><br>
        Back to the details
        <br><br>
        The theme from the previous version doesn't work with the upgraded version.  I will try to move
        back some of the elements from the old theme if possible as we progress.  This newer version of
        the forum is more modern and user-friendly, it will take some time to get used to (for me at least).
        I haven't take the time to discover all the features and to check if everything is working
        as they should.  So please let me know if you find something is missing, broken or out of place.
        <br><br>
        The NexusHub search page is not yet fully complete.  I will have to fix it later.
        The shoutbox will not come back, I can't find a substitute for it that works, but it should be fine.
        It should be a good idea to do without that many add-ons going forward so upgrading will not be as painful.
        <br><br>
        On a side note ...
        <br><br>
        It's not too late to go back to the old version  /heh but then we will have to stuck with it
        for as long as the forum stay alive.  Given the usage, I think we can live with this unless there
        is a very good reason to go back to the old version. Thank you all for your continued support!!

        <br><br>
        7. Investing Wisely:

        Once you've accumulated a substantial amount of Zeny, consider investing it wisely to

        Greetings, adventurers of Midgard!
        <br><br>
        Today, let's dive into a topic that sparks lively debates among the Ragnarok community: Ragnarok Mobile
        versus Ragnarok Online. With the rise of Ragnarok Mobile and its growing popularity, many players
        find themselves torn between the classic PC experience of Ragnarok Online and the convenience of
        mobile gaming. Let's explore the differences and share our thoughts on these two iterations of the
        beloved MMORPG.
        <br><br>
        1. Gameplay Experience:
        Ragnarok Online, with its nostalgic 2D graphics and point-and-click mechanics, offers a classic
        MMORPG experience that many players grew up with. On the other hand, Ragnarok Mobile boasts modern
        3D graphics, streamlined controls, and optimized gameplay for mobile devices. Which gameplay style
        do you prefer, and why? Do you enjoy the simplicity of Ragnarok Mobile's interface, or do you miss
        the complexity of Ragnarok Online's mechanics?
        <br><br>
        2. Community and Social Interaction:
        One of the hallmarks of Ragnarok Online is its vibrant community and social interaction.
        From joining guilds to participating in WoE (War of Emperium) battles, RO fostered a sense
        of camaraderie among players. How does the community aspect compare between Ragnarok Mobile
        and Ragnarok Online? Do you find it easier to connect with other players in one version over
        the other? Share your experiences of forming friendships, alliances, and rivalries in both games.
        <br><br>
        3. Content and Updates:
        Both Ragnarok Mobile and Ragnarok Online receive regular updates and new content to keep
        players engaged. Ragnarok Mobile introduces exclusive features such as the Pet System,
        Multi-Job System, and Endless Tower, while Ragnarok Online continues to expand its world with
        new maps, dungeons, and quests. Which game do you think offers a more satisfying content
        update cycle? Are there any features from one version that you wish were implemented in the other?
        <br><br>
        4. Accessibility and Convenience:
        One of the biggest advantages of Ragnarok Mobile is its accessibility. With the ability to
        play on-the-go from your mobile device, Ragnarok Mobile allows players to immerse themselves
        in the world of Midgard anytime, anywhere. However, some players argue that Ragnarok Online's
        PC-based platform offers a more immersive and customizable gaming experience. How do you balance
        the convenience of mobile gaming with the depth of PC gaming? Do you find yourself favoring one
        version over the other based on your gaming preferences and lifestyle?
        <br><br>
        5. Nostalgia vs. Innovation:
        For many players, Ragnarok Online holds a special place in their hearts as a nostalgic journey
        into their gaming past. However, Ragnarok Mobile brings a fresh perspective to the franchise
        with its innovative features and modern design. How do you reconcile your fond memories of
        Ragnarok Online with the new experiences offered by Ragnarok Mobile? Do you think one version
        does a better job of capturing the essence of Ragnarok's world and gameplay?
        <br><br>
        Share your thoughts, experiences, and opinions on the ongoing debate between Ragnarok Mobile and
        Ragnarok Online. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the classic PC version or a mobile gamer
        embracing the future of Ragnarok, your voice matters in shaping the future of our beloved MMORPG.

        Do you miss the Golden Times of Ragnarok? What about a pre-renewal balanced server for whatever do
        you like to do most? Here you may find cool stuff trough MvP Points, Event Points, Mission Points,
        Bring the Items Quests or Cash Points (also obtained by voting), you choose for which way do you
        want to go!
        <br><br><br>
        What do you like do to most?
        <br>
        Party Play - You can pick party quests for killing a good amount of monsters in certain map
        (you choose!), at the end you and your party will get some extra EXP and an item reward! You
        may also find specific achievements for killing monsters, those also count for your party
        (since they are with you)! No more abandoned support classes, now your presence counts!

        Solo Play - Like the party quests you can also pick solo quests, but you may find easier monsters
        for hunt, less monsters needed to complete que quest and more spot options! At the end of the

        those are for high level headgears. Get special MvP hunting achievements!
        <br><br>

        level characters -, daily EXP - simple quests for daily EXP reward, no need to go hunt lots
        of monsters! -, custom mining system - a nice story-line for you to follow and things to do
        before mastering your skills -, explorer achievements - explore the Ragnarok world, complete

        Faction system: Meet new people in your faction, elect your faction leader, kill other faction
        members, win faction wars! You can choose between 4 factions: Aeronauts (Yuno), Hermits (Payon),
