            Do you miss the Golden Times of Ragnarok? What about a pre-renewal balanced server for whatever do
            you like to do most? Here you may find cool stuff trough MvP Points, Event Points, Mission Points,
            Bring the Items Quests or Cash Points (also obtained by voting), you choose for which way do you
            want to go!
            <br><br><br>
            What do you like do to most?
            <br>
            Party Play - You can pick party quests for killing a good amount of monsters in certain map
            (you choose!), at the end you and your party will get some extra EXP and an item reward! You
            may also find specific achievements for killing monsters, those also count for your party
            (since they are with you)! No more abandoned support classes, now your presence counts!
            <br><br>
            Solo Play - Like the party quests you can also pick solo quests, but you may find easier monsters
            for hunt, less monsters needed to complete que quest and more spot options! At the end of the
            hunting you may also get an extra EXP and an item reward depending on the selected monster.
            You may conquer different medals in achievements for killing large groups of monsters!
            <br><br>
            Guild Play - If you bring your guild to join us you will get a cool guild pack, even if it's a
            small friends' guild (4 or more player counts)!
            <br><br>
            MvP Hunt - To each MvP killed you will get MvP Points, that can be traded later for some
            nice stuff in the MvP Token Shop! Some *Bring the Items* quests require MvP items,
            those are for high level headgears. Get special MvP hunting achievements!
            <br><br>
            Role Playing - You can experience our unique quests for headgears - don't require high
            level characters -, daily EXP - simple quests for daily EXP reward, no need to go hunt lots
            of monsters! -, custom mining system - a nice story-line for you to follow and things to do
            before mastering your skills -, explorer achievements - explore the Ragnarok world, complete
            quests and get special achievements - and more!
            <br><br>
            Guild Wars - If you like the traditional War of Emperium, for sure you should try our
            Faction system: Meet new people in your faction, elect your faction leader, kill other faction
            members, win faction wars! You can choose between 4 factions: Aeronauts (Yuno), Hermits (Payon),
            Marauders (Morocc) and Pirates (Alberta). After entering a faction you get access to an
            exclusive #faction channel (each one have its own channel), some management commands
            (like @factionannounce), members have different colored auras and speak in different colors
            at the regular chat, some bonus stats, nice discount buying items from NPCs in your faction
            hometown and access to an extra dungeon and specific mobs!
            <br><br>

            seems like a promising server, I might consider joining if the population is high since low rates
