                        Consider factors such as monster respawn rates, mob density, and drop rates to maximize your
                        earnings per hour.
                        <br><br>

                        <br>
                        Once you've accumulated a substantial amount of Zeny, consider investing it wisely to
                        generate passive income. Explore opportunities such as vending, rental services, or investing
                        in rare items with long-term value appreciation potential. Diversify your investments and
                        monitor your returns to ensure sustainable growth over time.
