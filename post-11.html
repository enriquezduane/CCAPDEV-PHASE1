            Welcome, aspiring adventurers, to the world of Ragnarok Online! Embarking on your journey
            into Midgard can be both exciting and daunting, especially when it comes to choosing and
            advancing your first job. Fear not, for this beginner's guide is here to help you navigate
            the process and set you on the path to greatness.
            <br><br>
            1. Understanding the Basics:
            <br>
            Before delving into job advancements, it's essential to grasp the fundamentals of Ragnarok Online.
            Familiarize yourself with the game's mechanics, controls, and user interface. Take some time to
            explore Prontera, the starting city, and interact with NPCs to learn more about the world around you.
            <br><br>
            2. Choosing Your First Job:
            <br>
            In Ragnarok Online, players begin their journey as Novices, the jack-of-all-trades class.
            As you gain experience and reach Base Level 10, you'll have the opportunity to choose your
            first job. Consider your preferred playstyle, whether it's dealing damage up close, casting
            spells from a distance, or providing support to your party members. Research the available
            job classes and their respective skills to find the one that suits you best.
            <br><br>
            3. Job Advancement Quests:
            <br>
            Once you've made your decision, it's time to undergo the job advancement process. Each
            job class has its own unique quest that must be completed to advance. These quests often
            involve gathering items, defeating monsters, or performing tasks for NPCs. Pay close
            attention to the quest requirements and follow the instructions carefully to successfully
            advance to your chosen job.
            <br><br>
            4. Building Your Character:
            <br>
            As you progress through your chosen job class, you'll have the opportunity to
            customize your character's skills and attributes. Experiment with different builds
            to find the playstyle that best suits you. Whether you prefer to specialize in offensive,
            defensive, or supportive abilities, there's a build out there to match your preferences.
            Don't be afraid to seek advice from experienced players or consult online guides for build
            recommendations.
            <br><br>
            5. Leveling Up and Exploring:
            <br>
            With your new job class in hand, it's time to venture forth into the world of Ragnarok Online
            and embark on your quest for adventure. Explore new maps, defeat monsters, complete quests,
            and participate in party activities to level up and improve your skills. Take advantage of the
            game's social features to join parties, make friends, and tackle challenges together.
            <br><br>
            6. Embracing the Journey:
            <br>
            Remember, Ragnarok Online is not just about reaching the highest level or obtaining the most
            powerful gear. It's about the experiences you have along the way, the friends you make, and
            the adventures you embark on together. Embrace the journey, savor the moments, and enjoy
            everything that Midgard has to offer.
            <br><br>
            Congratulations on taking your first steps into the world of Ragnarok Online! May your journey be filled
            with excitement, discovery, and countless epic battles. If you ever find yourself in need of guidance or
            assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to your fellow adventurers. Welcome to Midgard, and may your
            adventures be legendary!
