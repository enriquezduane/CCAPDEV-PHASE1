            While we don't have any events and contests yet since our forum is fairly new, we do plan to make a lot in
            the future though! Stay tuned and wait for announcements regarding this when the time comes.
            <br><br>
            <strong>7. Socialize and Make Friends</strong>:
            NexusHub isn't just about gaming; it's also about building friendships and connections. Join discussions,

            and
            everything. You never know, you might meet your future party members or guildmates here!
            <br><br>
            <strong>8. Rules and Guidelines</strong>:
            Last but not least, familiarize yourself with our forum rules and guidelines. We strive to maintain a
            friendly and
            respectful community, and adherence to our rules ensures a positive experience for everyone. Remember to
            respect your
            fellow players, keep discussions civil, and report any violations to our moderators.
